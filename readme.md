# Python Programming

----

> This course introduces beginners to the Python programming language, with a brief working intro to a special topic: either Data Science (Pandas) or Web Development (Flask).

## Overview
In this Python Programming course, students will walk away with a solid foundation in Python, able to confidently build basic applications. Students will also get an 8 hour dive into of one of two Python libraries -  either Pandas (for Data Science) or Flask (for Web Development), and walk away with a project of their choosing they've built using that library.

## Course Details
Python Programming is a 40-hour course, delivered as full-time or 10 week part time format. 

Course completion includes performing homework, labs, and a final project and also attendance requirements.

### Learning Objectives
The high-level learning objectives for this course are:

- Create a basic Python app, using control flow, classes, and try/catch statements.
- Incorporate APIs, modules, and user input into a Python app.
- Use Pandas to create a visualization of a dataset **or** use Flask to create and run a Python application (depending on the special topic track).

Students cannot graduate unless they demonstrate mastery of the above learning objectives before the end of the course. Mastery is measured through assessment: homeworks, in-class activities and final projects.

The official course syllabus, available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G5MxiLnVah4YAoJTzdIYK-8guTYC-Q7u/view), outlines what must be covered in the course.

Optional topics you may consider adding on to extend learning (provided your students are ready) include:
- More intermediate programming, such as decorators, logging, and unit tests.
- More interesting or specialized libraries, such as PyGame, NumPy, or Django.
